## More Config

In a new package called exercise:

Have Spring configure a ProjectManager that has:
- An architect
- Two tradespeople - a builder and a plumber; each of which work (the builder builds and the plumber plumbs)
- A personal assistant (optional)
- A Dogsbody who works fast (there should be two Dogsbodies available - one fast, one slow)

Each tradesperson has a name that should be specified in the environment.
The builder is named Bob, and the plumber is Paul.
